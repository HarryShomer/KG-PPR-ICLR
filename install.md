# Installation

We detail the installation process using Conda on Linux. Note that all environments used can be found in the `envs` directory.


## 1. Install Conda
```
curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

## 2. Setup Code and Packages for Most Experiments

The system and CUDA version used for the majority of experiments are:
- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- CUDA 11.6
- Python 3.9.13

We first clone the repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:HarryShomer/Better-Inductive-KGC.git
cd Better-Inductive-KGC/
```

The package requirements can be found in the `envs/std_env.yml` file. Installing this will also create an environment for the project called `std_env`. 
```
# Install environment requirements
conda env create -f envs/std_env.yml   

# Activate environment
conda activate std_env
```

## 3. Setup Code and Packages for Rest of Experiments

ULTRA and Nodepiece require different environments.

Nodepiece requires python `3.8.19`. The full package requirements can be found in `nodepiece_env.yaml`.

ULTRA requires python `3.9.19`. The full package requirements can be found in `ultra_env.yaml`.

These environments can be set up in the same manner as before.

## 4. CUDA (optional)

Lastly, we note that the correct CUDA version can be installed multiple ways. For manual installation, please see [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html). On a HPCC system, the correct version can be ativated via SLURM. Please see [here](https://hpcf.umbc.edu/gpu/how-to-run-on-the-gpus/) for more details.
